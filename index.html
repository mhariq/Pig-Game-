        Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many
        points as the total shown on the die providing the die does not roll a
        1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk
        rolling a 1) or end his turn. If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over,
        he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to
        the next player. Play passes from player to player until a winner is
        determined. How do you win? The first player to accumulate 25 or more
        points wins the game.
